1. Constructor

A constructor is a special function inside a class that automatically runs when an object is created.
Its purpose is to initialize data members of the class.

Key Points about Constructors:

1. Name of constructor = name of class.

2. No return type (not even void).

3. Called automatically when you create an object.

4. You can have multiple constructors (called constructor overloading).



2. Access Specifiers

Access specifiers decide who can access the data members and functions of a class.
There are three main access specifiers in C++:

Specifier	           Who Can Access	                                              Use Case
public	      Everyone (from anywhere in the program)     	         Functions that should be available to users
private	          Only within the class itself	                      Protect data members, hide implementation details
protected	     Class itself + derived (child) classes                        	Used in inheritance
