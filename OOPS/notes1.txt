1. Class

A class is like a blueprint or template used to create objects.
It defines what data (attributes) and what actions (methods) the objects will have.

Example (in simple terms):
Think of a class as the design of a car. It specifies what parts (engine, wheels, color) and actions (start, stop, honk) every car should have.


2. Object

An object is a real-world instance of a class.
When you create (or "instantiate") a class, you get an object.

Example:
If the class is Car, an object might be myCar, which is a specific car with a color "red" and model "Tesla Model 3."


3. Data Members (Attributes or Fields)

Data members are variables inside a class that hold the data/state of the object.

Example (Car):

color

speed

fuelLevel

Each object will have its own copy of these data members.


4. Data Functions (Member Functions / Methods)

Data functions are functions defined inside a class that operate on its data members.
They describe the behavior of the object.

Example (Car):

startEngine()

accelerate()

applyBrakes()

These functions can access and modify the objectâ€™s data members.
